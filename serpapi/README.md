# SerpAPI Integration

Unified Autohive integration for accessing reviews from Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Google Maps using SerpAPI.

## Overview

This integration consolidates three separate review sources into a single, unified integration:
- **Apple App Store** - iOS app reviews
- **Google Play Store** - Android app reviews
- **Google Maps** - Business reviews

All sources are powered by [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/), requiring only a single API key.

## Features

### Apple App Store
- Search for iOS apps by name or developer
- Fetch app reviews with sorting options (most recent, helpful, favorable, critical)
- Automatic app ID resolution from app names
- Pagination support

### Google Play Store
- Search for Android apps by name
- Fetch app reviews with platform and rating filters
- Sort by relevance, newest, or rating
- Automatic app ID resolution from app names
- Pagination support

### Google Maps
- Search for businesses by name and location
- Fetch business reviews with sorting options
- Automatic place ID resolution from business names
- Pagination support

## Migration Guide

If you're migrating from the standalone integrations (`appstore_reviews`, `google_play_reviews`, `google_map_reviews`), here's the action mapping:

### From `appstore_reviews` → `serpapi`
- `search_apps` → `search_apps_ios`
- `get_app_reviews` → `get_reviews_app_store`

### From `google_play_reviews` → `serpapi`
- `search_apps` → `search_apps_android`
- `get_app_reviews` → `get_reviews_google_play`

### From `google_map_reviews` → `serpapi`
- `search_places` → `search_places_google_maps`
- `get_google_maps_reviews` → `get_reviews_google_maps`

**Key Changes:**
1. **Single API key**: Use the same SerpAPI key for all three sources
2. **Action names**: Updated to include platform identifiers (ios, android, google_maps)
3. **Identical functionality**: All parameters and outputs remain the same

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Get iOS App Reviews
```python
# Search for the app
search_result = await serpapi.execute_action("search_apps_ios", {
    "term": "WhatsApp",
    "country": "us"
}, context)

# Get reviews using app ID
reviews_result = await serpapi.execute_action("get_reviews_app_store", {
    "product_id": "310633997",
    "country": "us",
    "sort": "mostrecent",
    "max_pages": 5
}, context)
```

### Example 2: Get Android App Reviews by Name
```python
# Automatically resolves app ID from name
reviews_result = await serpapi.execute_action("get_reviews_google_play", {
    "app_name": "WhatsApp",
    "rating": 5,
    "sort_by": 2,  # Newest first
    "max_pages": 3
}, context)
```

### Example 3: Get Google Maps Reviews by Business Name
```python
# Automatically resolves place ID from query
# IMPORTANT: Use simple business name only, not full address
reviews_result = await serpapi.execute_action("get_reviews_google_maps", {
    "query": "Starbucks Reserve Roastery",  # Just business name
    "location": "Seattle, WA",  # City and state/country
    "sort_by": "newestFirst",
    "num_reviews": 20,
    "max_pages": 5
}, context)
```

### Example 4: Get Google Maps Reviews by Place ID (Recommended)
```python
# Most reliable method - use place_id directly
reviews_result = await serpapi.execute_action("get_reviews_google_maps", {
    "place_id": "ChIJdwFEqNmvOG0RDdhA0UWZgiw",
    "sort_by": "newestFirst",
    "num_reviews": 10,
    "max_pages": 3
}, context)
```

## Best Practices

### Google Maps Reviews - Tips for Success

**✅ DO:**
- Use `place_id` directly when you have it (most reliable method)
- Keep business names simple: "Starbucks" not "Starbucks on Main Street"
- Separate business name and location into different parameters
- Use city and country format for location: "Wellington, New Zealand"
- Search for the place first using `search_places_google_maps` if you don't have the place_id

**❌ DON'T:**
- Don't include full street addresses in the query parameter
- Don't combine business name with location in a single string
- Don't use overly specific queries like "Restaurant on Cuba Street at Te Aro"

**Example of GOOD vs BAD queries:**

❌ BAD:
```python
{
    "query": "Yor Yak Thai Eatery on Cuba Street at Te Aro, Wellington"
}
```

✅ GOOD:
```python
{
    "query": "Yor Yak Thai Eatery",
    "location": "Wellington, New Zealand"
}
```

✅ BEST:
```python
{
    "place_id": "ChIJdwFEqNmvOG0RDdhA0UWZgiw"
}
```
