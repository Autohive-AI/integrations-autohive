# The login_customer_id is the MCC account ID if you are accessing accounts via an MCC.
# If you are accessing a single account directly that is not under an MCC,
# you can often omit this or set it to the same ID as the customer_id you use in your API calls,
# but without hyphens (e.g., 1234567890).
# It's required if the account you're authenticating with (associated with the refresh_token)
# needs to act on behalf of other customer accounts.
# login_customer_id: LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID_NO_HYPHENS (e.g., 1234567890, optional)

# Recommended setting for using proto-plus messages, which offer a more Pythonic interface.
