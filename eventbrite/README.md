  "result": false,
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- **Authentication errors**: Token expired or invalid permissions
- **Not found errors**: Resource (event, venue, etc.) doesn't exist
- **Validation errors**: Missing required fields or invalid data
- **Permission errors**: Insufficient permissions for the operation

## Rate Limiting

Eventbrite API has rate limits. The integration handles rate limiting gracefully, but for high-volume operations, consider spacing out requests.

## Support

For issues with this integration, please check:
1. Your Eventbrite OAuth connection is active
2. You have the required permissions for the operation
3. The resource IDs are correct and accessible
