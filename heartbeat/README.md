# Heartbeat Integration for Autohive

Connects Autohive to the Heartbeat.chat API to allow users to retrieve channel information, manage threads and comments, access user data, and view community events.

## Description

This integration provides comprehensive access to Heartbeat.chat community data through their API. It enables users to:

- Retrieve channels and their details
- Access threads within channels and create new ones
- Manage comments on threads
- Get user information and community member data
- View community events and their details

The integration interacts with the Heartbeat.chat API v0 to provide standardized data structures for all community content.

## Setup & Authentication

To configure this integration in Autohive, you'll need a Heartbeat.chat Bearer token with appropriate permissions.

**Authentication Fields:**

*   `api_key`: Your Heartbeat.chat Bearer token (API key)

To obtain your API key:
1. Log into your Heartbeat.chat community
2. Navigate to your account settings or developer settings
3. Generate or copy your API Bearer token
4. Use this token as the `api_key` in the Autohive integration configuration

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Get all channels and then retrieve threads from the first channel**

```json
{
  "action": "get_heartbeat_channels"
}
```

Then use the channel ID from the result:

```json
{
  "channel_id": "channel_id_from_previous_result"
}
```

**Example 2: Create a new thread in a specific channel**

```json
{
  "channel_id": "your_channel_id",
  "content": "Hello! This is a new thread created via the API."
}
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

1.  Navigate to the integration's directory: `cd heartbeat`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Update the API key in `tests/test_heartbeat.py` (replace `YOUR_HEARTBEAT_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Bearer token)
4.  Run the tests: `python tests/test_heartbeat.py`

Note: The tests include placeholder IDs that will need to be replaced with actual IDs from your Heartbeat community for full functionality testing.
