# Typeform Integration for Autohive

Connects Autohive to the Typeform API for managing forms, responses, workspaces, themes, images, and webhooks.

## Description

This integration provides comprehensive access to Typeform's form building and data collection platform. It allows users to create and manage forms, retrieve responses, organize workspaces, customize themes, manage images, and configure webhooks programmatically.

The integration uses Typeform REST API with OAuth 2.0 authentication and implements 24 actions covering all major Typeform operations.

## Setup & Authentication

This integration uses **OAuth 2.0** authentication for secure access to your Typeform account.

### Authentication Method

The integration uses OAuth 2.0 with the following scopes:
- `accounts:read` - Read account information
- `forms:read` - Access form lists and details
- `forms:write` - Create, update, and delete forms
- `responses:read` - Retrieve form submissions
- `responses:write` - Delete form submissions
- `workspaces:read` - Access workspace data
- `workspaces:write` - Create and modify workspaces
- `themes:read` - Access theme information
- `themes:write` - Create and modify themes
- `images:read` - Retrieve images
- `images:write` - Add and remove images
- `webhooks:read` - View webhook configurations
- `webhooks:write` - Create and manage webhooks
- `offline` - Receive refresh token for long-term access

### Setup Steps in Autohive

1. Add Typeform integration in Autohive
2. Click "Connect to Typeform" to authorize the integration
3. Sign in to your Typeform account when prompted
4. Review and authorize the requested permissions
5. You'll be redirected back to Autohive once authorization is complete

The OAuth integration automatically handles token management and refresh (tokens expire after 1 week and are automatically refreshed).

## Action Results
