# Zoho CRM Integration for Autohive

Connects Autohive to the Zoho CRM API to provide comprehensive customer relationship management capabilities, including contact management, sales pipeline tracking, lead conversion, and activity management.

## Description

This integration provides full access to Zoho CRM functionality through Autohive, enabling users to manage their entire customer lifecycle. It supports complete CRUD operations across all major CRM modules including contacts, accounts, deals, leads, tasks, events, and calls. The integration also provides advanced relationship mapping and custom query capabilities through Zoho's COQL query language.

Key features include:
- Complete contact and account management with detailed profile information
- Sales pipeline management with deal tracking and conversion
- Lead management with automated conversion workflows  
- Task and activity management for CRM productivity
- Event scheduling and call logging for communication tracking
- Advanced relationship queries and hierarchical data access
- Custom COQL queries for complex data operations

This integration interacts with Zoho CRM API v8 and supports all standard CRM operations with proper error handling and data validation.

## Setup & Authentication

The integration uses Zoho's OAuth 2.0 platform authentication. No manual API key configuration is required - authentication is handled automatically through Autohive's platform integration system.

**Required Scopes:**
The integration automatically requests the following Zoho CRM permissions:
- `ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.ALL` - Full access to contacts module
- `ZohoCRM.modules.accounts.ALL` - Full access to accounts module  
- `ZohoCRM.modules.deals.ALL` - Full access to deals module

- `ZohoCRM.modules.events.ALL` - Full access to events module
- `ZohoCRM.modules.calls.ALL` - Full access to calls module
- `ZohoCRM.coql.READ` - Access to execute COQL queries

**Setup Steps:**
1. Configure the Zoho integration in your Autohive platform
2. Authorize the integration through Zoho's OAuth flow
3. Grant the required permissions when prompted
4. The integration will automatically handle token management and refresh

## Common Workflows

### Lead-to-Deal Conversion Process
1. Create a lead using `create_lead`

4. Manage the resulting deal through the sales pipeline with deal actions

### Customer Onboarding Workflow  
1. Create account using `create_account`
2. Add primary contact with `create_contact`
3. Create onboarding tasks with `create_task`
4. Schedule kickoff meeting with `create_event`
5. Track activities and follow-ups

### Sales Pipeline Management
1. Create deals from converted leads or new opportunities
2. Update deal stages and probability as they progress
3. Associate tasks and events for deal activities
4. Use `get_deal_relationships` to view complete deal context
5. Generate reports using COQL queries

## Testing

To run the tests included with the integration:

1. Navigate to the integration's directory: `cd Zoho`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt -t dependencies`
3. Set up test environment with valid Zoho CRM test credentials
4. Run the tests: `python tests/test_integration.py`

The test suite includes:

- Advanced operations and COQL query tests

## API Limitations

- Zoho CRM API has rate limits (typically 100 calls per minute per organization)
- Some fields may be read-only depending on your Zoho CRM edition and configuration
- COQL queries have syntax limitations and performance considerations
- Related record operations depend on proper CRM module relationships being configured
