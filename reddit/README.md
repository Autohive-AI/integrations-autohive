## Authentication Setup

This integration uses Reddit's OAuth system:

1. The integration will redirect you to Reddit for authorization
2. Grant permissions for `read` (view content) and `submit` (post comments)
3. You'll be redirected back to Autohive with access granted

**Note**: You need a verified Reddit account (confirmed email) to use this integration.

## Best Practices

### Respectful Automation
- Follow each subreddit's rules and guidelines
- Avoid spammy or repetitive comments
- Engage meaningfully with the community
- Respect rate limits (approximately 60 requests per minute)

### Content Guidelines
- Keep comments relevant and helpful
- Disclose when appropriate that responses are automated
- Monitor and moderate your automated interactions
- Have human oversight for sensitive discussions

### Performance Tips
- Use specific search terms to get more relevant results
- Set appropriate limits to avoid overwhelming your workflows

## Getting Parent IDs

To reply to posts or comments, you need the correct ID format:

- **Post IDs**: Start with `t3_` (e.g., `t3_abc123`)
- **Comment IDs**: Start with `t1_` (e.g., `t1_def456`)

These IDs are returned in the search results, or you can extract them from Reddit URLs.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't authenticate?**
- Ensure your Reddit account email is verified
- Check that you're granting the required permissions
- Try clearing browser cache and reconnecting

**Search returning no results?**
- Verify subreddit name spelling (case matters)
- Check if the subreddit is public and accessible
- Try broader search terms

**Comments not posting?**
- Confirm you have permission to post in that subreddit
- Check the parent ID format is correct
- Some subreddits have karma or account age requirements
