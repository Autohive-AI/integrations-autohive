# RSS Reader Integration for Autohive using feedparser

This integration allows Autohive to connect with RSS feeds, enabling users to fetch and process feed entries from any RSS-compatible source.

## Description

The RSS Reader integration provides a simple way to access and process RSS feed content within Autohive workflows. It uses the feedparser library to load and parse RSS feeds and extract relevant information such as titles, links, descriptions, and publication dates. This integration is particularly useful for monitoring news sources, blogs, or any other RSS-enabled content.

## Setup & Authentication

The integration via feedparser supports optional **HTTP basic authentication** for RSS feeds that require credentials. Any other authentication requirements that are [supported by feedparser](https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/http-authentication.html) beyond that, will need to be added to this integration via PRs.

While most public RSS feeds don't require authentication, some private or protected feeds may need username and password credentials.

**Authentication Fields:**

*   `user_name`: Username for the RSS feed (if authentication is required)
*   `password`: Password for the RSS feed (if authentication is required)

## Actions

### Action: `get_feed`

*   **Description:** Retrieves entries from a specified RSS feed URL
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `feed_url`: The URL of the RSS feed to read (required)
    *   `limit`: Maximum number of entries to return (optional, defaults to 10)
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `feed_title`: Title of the RSS feed
    *   `feed_link`: Link to the RSS feed
    *   `entries`: Array of feed entries, each containing:
        *   `title`: Entry title
        *   `link`: Link to entry
        *   `description`: The description of the entry
        *   `published`: Published date
        *   `author`: Author
